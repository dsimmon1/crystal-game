# crystal-game

I created this game for the UCLA Coding Bootcamp homework week 4 assignment. This is my version of the crystal game. The screen on load has the game instructions.  Upon clicking play, the game loads.   

Getting Started

Open the website and press play to play the game.  The game updates with new crystal values and a new target number.
